tooltips:
  regression_summary: |
    The regression summary shows the statistical results of your model:
    - Coefficients: The estimated effect of each predictor on the dependent variable
    - Standard Errors: Uncertainty in the coefficient estimates
    - t-values: Test statistics for each coefficient
    - p-values: Probability of observing these results under the null hypothesis
    - R-squared: Proportion of variance explained by the model
    - Adjusted R-squared: R-squared adjusted for number of predictors
    - F-statistic: Overall model significance test

  anova_table: |
    The Type I (Sequential) ANOVA table shows how each predictor contributes to the model:
    - Sum of Squares: Amount of variance explained by each predictor
    - Degrees of Freedom: Number of independent pieces of information
    - Mean Square: Sum of Squares divided by Degrees of Freedom
    - F-value: Test statistic for each predictor's significance
    - p-value: Probability of observing these results under the null hypothesis
    The order of predictors matters in Type I ANOVA.

  correlation_matrix: |
    The correlation matrix shows relationships between all variables:
    - Red: Positive correlation (variables increase together)
    - Blue: Negative correlation (variables move in opposite directions)
    - Darker colors: Stronger correlations
    - Lighter colors: Weaker correlations
    - White: No correlation
    Hover over cells to see exact correlation values.

  residual_plot: |
    The residual plot helps diagnose model assumptions:
    - X-axis: Predicted values from the model
    - Y-axis: Residuals (actual - predicted values)
    - Red line: Zero line (ideal case)
    - Blue line: Trend line of residuals
    Look for:
    - Random scatter around zero
    - No clear patterns or trends
    - Equal spread across predicted values
    - No extreme outliers

  data_table: |
    The data table shows your raw data with interactive features:
    - Sort: Click column headers to sort
    - Filter: Use the filter boxes below headers
    - Select: Click rows to highlight them
    - Search: Use the search box to find specific values
    - Pagination: Navigate through large datasets
    - Export: Download the filtered/sorted data

  predictor_selection: |
    Select predictors for your regression model:
    - Numeric variables: Continuous measurements
    - Binary variables (marked with b): Two-category variables
    - Order matters: Variables are added in selection order
    - Start with most important predictors
    - Consider multicollinearity

  dataset_selection: |
    Choose your dataset for analysis:
    - Each dataset has its own configuration
    - Dependent variable is pre-selected
    - Available predictors are listed
    - Data is automatically loaded and processed
    - Binary variables are converted to 0/1
